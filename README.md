# Signal-Processing-For-Space-Communications
This project simulates BPSK and Gray-coded QPSK transmission over an AWGN channel and evaluates Bit Error Rate (BER) versus Eb/N0 using Monte Carlo methods. Results are validated against theoretical curves and supported by constellation and eye diagram to analyze SNR impact on digital link reliability in noise-limited communication systems.
